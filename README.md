# Problem Statement:
An interactive web page that presents users with a series of questions upon their first visit. These questions are displayed as individual cards. Once all questions are answered, the web page transitions to a title screen. Additionally, if a user refreshes or revisits the page after answering the questions, the page should directly display the title screen without showing the questions again.

# Implementation Details:
1. HTML: Structure the web page to include question cards and a title screen.
2. CSS: Style the question cards and title screen for a visually appealing layout.
3. JavaScript: Implement logic to handle the display of question cards, saving answers, and transitioning to the title screen.
